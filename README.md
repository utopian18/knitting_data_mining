# Data Processing and Machine Learning for Knitting Dataset

This repository provides a complete workflow for preprocessing a structued knitting dataset from daily production report,
analyzing, and applying multiple machine learning models to a knitting-related dataset. The aim is to extract insights, classify patterns, or predict outcomes based on knitting production or structure data.

## 📌 Features

- 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- 🧮 Feature Engineering and Normalization
- 🤖 Multiple Machine Learning Model Implementation (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
- 📊 Model Evaluation and Comparison
- 🔁 Modular and Reusable Codebase

## 🧵 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is related to knitting parameters, which may include variables such as:
- Yarn count (Ne and Tex)
- Stitch length ( for all loops)
- Machine gauge
- Fabric GSM
- composiiton
- body parts
- construction 
- Production output (shiftwise and total)
- rejection
- tightness factor (engineered feature)
  etc.
